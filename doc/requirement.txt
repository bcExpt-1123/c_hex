CATS (Caribbean Alternative Trading System)

We need to build a Decentralized Exchange Platform where companies registered in the Caribbean can list their ECR20 tokens. They should have access using MetaMask or any ECR20 compatible wallet. They should be able to deposit, withdraw and transfer their tokens between exchange and wallet. Balance, orderbook, price chart, trades, volume are essential parts of this platform. User friendly is key. Trading pairs for all KYC approved token listings are all ETH or USDT. Any additional ideas you might have are more than welcome. The intention is to create a platform where start up and established companies in the Caribbean obtain funding for their projects.
Integrate KYC and keep in mind that the core idea is for startups and established companies in the Caribbean to have access and a chance to raise funds for specific projects.
We need seamless connection with MetaMask or other compatible Ecr20 token wallet. ETH, USDT and Ecr20 token ability for transfer, deposit and withdrawal to exchange wallet. Exchange will require single order book any further suggestions on order book are welcome. I think ECR20 is the standard we all know, easy to create for less tech people and easy to deploy. No minting shit for a market such as the Caribbean.
It's imperative that the company that we approach or that reach out to us will need to fill and upload KYC forms, as well as links to their websites and white paper section. Some of these white papers I read are mostly from tech companies that don't even have a dime in their account. A lot of fancy blah blah promising shit they can never deliver. There is no decentralized exchange out there where e.g. a dividend contract is integrated and that issuer cannot mess with it. Issuing a token is easy but there needs to be an assurance that if an individual purchase a large amount of tokens in a company that the company issuing the tokens guarantees at least a year of dividends to the token holder whatever that percentage maybe. For example if a company like us, medium size well established issue a fixed supply of 10 million equivalent to 10 million usd with the promise of a 9% ROI than my guess would be that the minimal balance on the exchange should be equal to 9% of the total revenue generated by the tokens to at least cover some risk in case the issuer fails in its efforts to reach it economic goal.
Business people do not wish to copy paste any ox-protocol address, ticker symbol and decimals into a drop down menu of tokens so they can purchase a token and then have to search and waste time in actually finding the company behind it. No, they want a drop down menu with registered tokens, linked with websites, chamber of commerce documents and pragmatic white paper stating what the company does and how in an easy and efficient matter so that they can decide if they wish to engage or not And if they wish to participate in offering tokens than they want easy forms where they can fill in their total supply, exchange rate, upload their logo so it looks good on the monitor, link their website, and if they see something they really like but have no ethereum in their wallet than they wish a direct link were to buy ETH or USDT with their platinum visa cards. Show me a good clean code in github that really deals very well with the concept of a smart dividend token (preventing double spending...Alice has tokens for example and claims dividend and transfers to Joe the neighbour and he claims the dividends again).Airdrop deployment should be part of the platform as well you can visit 
and there you will find what I do. There are a lot of people and companies out there in the Caribbean that are good in what they do but our banking system is built on patronage. We wish additional funding because we wish to go beyond our borders, but there are much younger people out there that have great ideas and innovative ways of building a business but lack the funds. I can go about my business and still make money but I believe in bringing the right companies and people in our community together and circumenvent the banking system, banking the unbanked as we say.
Personally I do not have to make money with this portal, as long as we can cover the cost in maintaining and operating it, its fine with me. For me it's just a tool to introduce blockchain to others so that they can use it to their benefit and that of future businesses in the Caribbean.
both Forkdelta does not help you create, deploy and compile a ECR20 token for your company. And if you look at the registered tokens in the dropdownlist below DAI than you know looking at the list that most of them are shittokens. My idea is to setup a user platform and that we screen and approach on an executive level and if they join we list them with all details.
I will need KYC integration (so that my lawyers sleep well)
A basic KYC (such as blockpass) but without the selfie ....everybody hates selfies.
companies that wish listing need to upload their Chamber of Commerce 
I call it tokenomics version 2.0 
maybe you can talk to your blockchain expert and ask him if there is a algorithm that fairly calculates the increase in price when a token is bought.
tokens need transfer, deposit and withdrawal functions. The idea also and that is important that with Token creation the dividend payout is established. Companies should be free in how much they wish of their profit they wish to share in proportion of the tokens they sell of course. In normal business dividends are paid out on a yearly basis. Keep that in mind because if a venture capitalist invest his funds into something he will require a return. 
In technical terms with each token creation on the portal a smart dividend payout contract should be hard coded in proportion of the token sold and placed on an escrow ethereum account on the platform.  This will prevent the issuer of the token to withdraw all funds  and this gives insurance to the token holder that whatever happens with his investment he can claim at least a yearly dividend on his tokens.
all dividend payouts should be in ethereum
all pairs should be ETH and USDT
users of platform should have the option to buy ETH or USDT linked to a service provider such as visa. Simplex for instance for all  I care

Core idea of us does not seem to get through to nobody. We need a hybrid system. The ability for the user = company or startup to issue and deploy token on ethereum network. The ability to sell or purchase this token on our platform. KYC at the backend so we as the DEX platform owner can review and approve all token listings. Liquidity for the platform using Bots and some popular coins/tokens allready part of the platform. All tokens we approve for listing just need to be paired with ETH.
